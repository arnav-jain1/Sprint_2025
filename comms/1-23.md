# Chapter 1
## Network
The building blocks of networks are nodes and links
	Nodes:
		End systems (like computers)
		Switches, routers
	Links: connects nodes together
		Fiber, wires
		Can also be wireless (Wifi)
		Point to point: Like an ethernet cable that connects a router to a computer
		Multiple access (shared media): Shared link

Network: 2+ nodes connected by links
End node: The host
Internal nodes: switches and routers

The most important requirement is to provide connectivity, but performance (speed), scalability, stability, security, etc are important too

## Internetworking
Connecting networks
Router: special node that connects networks

Requires addressing schemes (ways to find someone) and routing schemes (how it will get there)

Address: Byte string that identifies a node (network)
	IPv4: 32 bits
Routing: The path that packets travel from start to dest
Forwarding: Advancing packets along the rout (more local limited to single node)

Ping does not give us information how the packet traveled just that it reached its destination or not


Address types:
	Unicast: 1-1, sending information from 1 to another
	Multicast: 1-Many, sending info from 1 to >1
	Broadcasting: 1-All, sending info from 1 to all nodes

## Network protocol
Network protocol is a way to respond to certain messages 


## Internet
The outside of the network is edge that's like computers that run the apps
	Hosts are the end systems
Network core are the interior that forward packets and data (router and switches)

Communication links: fiber, copper, radio, satiliite
	Bandwidth is how fast data can be transmitted 
	Two different types: Download and upload, download is more important

Internet is a network of networks
	Interconnected ISPs
Protocols are everywhere to manage the sending and recieving of messages (HTTP, streaming, ethernet, 4G, TCP, etc)
	When we use an ethernet cord, we are using a protocol 
Internet standards: 
	RFC: Requests for comments
	IETF: Internet engineering task force

The internet is infrastructure that provides services to apps
Provides a programming interface to distributed apps
	Hooks allow sending and reciving apps to connect to the intenet to transmit info
