3. While my shown screenshots were a small sample size, I ran it a few more times and found that UDP was consistently faster than TCP but not by much. There was also high variability. Another oddity I noticed was that TCP was faster once the connection was established but that might be an anomaly since this is such a packet. When I ran this on a friend's computer, I found that TCP was much slower which is to be expected
4. For TCP, there is less time client to server which I think is due to my implementation. There is some processing delay especially with TCP dealing with ACK and the server having to do stuff before being able to record the time (whereas the user records time immediately). For UDP, it is a bit faster server to client but again this could be due to implementation or the fact that since UDP is connectionless there is no ACK packet to be sent back. There is also a lot of variability and the more I ran it the more inconsistent results I got as sometimes it was about the same.
5. The time of day did not affect it much. It was about the same no matter what. I did some at noon, some at 8pm and some at 3am and all of them were about the same. If there was any difference it was marginal. The location didn't make much of a difference either. I assume this is because it was self hosted. If this was a larger scale application, I would assume there would be slight differences during high volume times
