Words in MIPS are 32 bits long
Right most bit is the LSB (because it only changes by 1)
Left most bit is the MSB (because it has a larger impact on the number)

You can represent $2^{32}-1$ as the max number (because of 0)


## Attempts to represent negatives 

**Let the first digit represent sign**
Let the left most bit determine the sign
Pros: Equal number of positive and negative
Cons: 2 0s, +0 and -0 (1000 and 0000), hard to do arithmitic 

**2s complement**: The MSB is just negative and the rest is positive so if the first bit is 1 then the number is negative, otherwise it is positive
There is also no
