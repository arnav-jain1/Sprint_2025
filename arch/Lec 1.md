COmputer architecture is the structure and organization of components that provides a computer functionality 
Earlier computer used vacuum tubes instead of transistors, transistors are smaller and like tiny switches
Transistors can be used to create logic gates


Integrated circuits are a collection of tiny components that are all working together in one unit
	Can have thousands of gates

Very large scale integration (VLSI): Process of creating an IC by combining 1000s of transistors into a single chip
	Pretty much needed and used everywhere
	Non-VLSI would have problems with higher transistors, longer wires, ineffecient and a lot more
