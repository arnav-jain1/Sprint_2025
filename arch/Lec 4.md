	Go through each multiplier if it is 0, shift the multiplicand left 1 bit (so that it becomes larger) and the multiplier right 1 bit (so that we go to the next bit). If it is 1, then add the multiplicand to the produce (in the product register) and then do the same thing 32 times


The thing is this is NOT effecient
