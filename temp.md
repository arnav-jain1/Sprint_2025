3 3/4: For b there are 4 scenarios: singular rows, pairs, groups of 3, all 4. Let a/b be row 1/2 and c/d be col 1/2
	Remember, the forumla is + singles, - pairs, + triples, - quadruples, etc.
	For singular rows, it leaves 2 elements so 10 * 10 = 100 * 4 since there are 4 possibilities (a or b or c or d) = 400, so +400
	For pairs, there are two scenarios
		a and b being 0s or c and d being 0 is the 0 matrix so 2 possibilities of just 1 matrix meaning 2 * 1 = 2
		a and c or b and d being 0 is all 0s except one element so subtract 4 * 10 = 40
		So total is -(40+2) = -42
	For triples, there are 4 combinations (abc, abd, abd, bcd) all of which are just the 0 matrix so 4 * 1 =4 so add 4
	All 4 is just the 0 matrix and there is only the 0 matrix so just -1
	Total is 400 -42 +4 -1 = 361
	10,000 - 361 = 9639
