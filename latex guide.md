# LaTeX Guide for Equations and Proofs

LaTeX is widely used for typesetting mathematical documents due to its powerful handling of mathematical notation. Below are common elements used in writing equations and proofs:

Note: For new line latex use \$\$ to surround the equation

## Superscript and Subscript

- Superscript: `a^2` renders as  $a^2$
- Subscript: `a_2` renders as $a_2$
	- Use {} for multiple characters: `a_{5a1}` renders as $a_{5a1}$

## Functions and Logarithms

- `\sin`, `\cos`, `\log`, etc.: `\sin(x)` renders as $\sin(x)$
- Logarithms: `\log_{2}(x)` renders as $\log_{2}(x)$
- Fractions: `\frac{a}{b}` renders as $\frac{a}{b}$

- nth Roots: `\sqrt[n]{x}` renders as $\sqrt[n]{x}$

## Set Notation

- Set of integers `\mathbb{Z}` renders as $\mathbb{Z}$

## Operators

- Summation: `\sum_{i=1}^{n}` renders as $\sum_{i=1}^{n}$
- Product: `\prod_{i=1}^{n}` renders as $\prod_{i=1}^{n}$

Matrices can be created using the `matrix` environment:

```
latex
\begin{matrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{matrix}
```
$$
\begin{matrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{matrix}
$$
